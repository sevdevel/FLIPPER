abstract = {A robust numerical procedure for biogeochemical interpretation and analysis of measured concentration profiles of solutes in sediment pore water has been developed. Assuming that the concentration-depth profile represents a steady state, the rate of net production or consumption as a function of depth can be calculated, together with the flux across the sediment-water interface. Three kinds of vertical transport can be included in the analysis: molecular diffusion, bioturbation, and irrigation. The procedure involves finding a series of least square fits to the measured concentration profile, followed by comparisons of these fits through statistical F-testing. This approach leads to an objective selection of the simplest production-consumption profile that reproduces the concentration profile. Because the numerical procedure is optimized with respect to speed, one prediction can typically be done in a few minutes or less on a personal computer. The technique has been tested successfully against analytical solutions describing the transport and consumption of O2 in sediment pore water. In other tests, measured concentration profiles of O2, NO3−, NH4+, and ΣCO2 have been interpreted using the new procedure.},

abstract = {Oxygen microelectrodes were used to analyze the distribution of the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) at the sediment-water interface in relation to surface topography and flow velocity. The sediment, collected from saline ponds, was covered by a microbial mat that had high oxygen consumption rate and well-defined surface structure. Diffusion through the DBL constituted an important rate limitation to the oxygen uptake of the sediment. The mean effective DBL thickness decreased from 0.59 to 0.16 mm as the flow velocity of the overlying water was increased from 0.3 to 7.7 cm s−1(measured 1 cm above the mat). The oxygen uptake rate concurrently increased from 3.9 to 9.4 nmol cm−2 min−1. The effects of surface roughness and topography on the thickness and distribution of the DBL were studied by three-dimensional mapping of the sediment-water interface and the upper DBL boundary at 0.1-mm spatial resolution. The DBL boundary followed mat structures that had characteristic dimensions >½ DBL thickness but the DBL had a dampened relief relative to the mat. The effective surface area of the sediment-water interface and of the upper DBL boundary were 31 and 14\% larger, respectively, than a flat plane. Surface topography thereby increased the oxygen flux across the sediment-water interface by 49\% relative to a one-dimensional diffusion flux calculated from the vertical oxygen microgradients.},

abstract = {Coastal and shelf sediments are considered as an important source of dissolved iron to the ocean. Here, we present a new numerical approach to estimate geochemical fluxes and production rates in an estuarine sediment at sub-millimetre resolution. This approach is based on application of Savitsky–Golay filter (SGF) procedure to two-dimensional concentration distributions of dissolved iron. We verified the procedure by applying it to artificial data of known production rates, and analysed the resulting uncertainty on production rates and fluxes across the water–sediment interface. This SGF procedure was applied to data from an intertidal mudflat that is densely inhabited by macrofauna (e.g. 630 indm−2 of Hediste diversicolor, I. Métais, pers.com.). Our analysis reveals an apparent recycling rate of 3780±1399μmolm−2d−1 and a mean residence time of iron in the dissolved phase of 2.3days. Visual identification of burrows permitted to calculate separately the diffusive flux across the sediment–water interface (104±20μmolm−2d−1) and the bio-irrigational flux (410±213μmolm−2d−1). Reactive iron particles will undergo on average 7.4cycles of dissolution/precipitation before being released to the water column. These results show that estuarine sediments support intensive iron recycling that has probably a large impact on terrigeneous particles before being released into the ocean.}
